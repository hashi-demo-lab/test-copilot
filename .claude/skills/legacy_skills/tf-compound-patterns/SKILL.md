# Compound Engineering Patterns for Terraform

## Core Principle

Each completed workflow run should leave the system better prepared for the next. Knowledge compounds — small, consistent investments in knowledge capture accumulate into exponential productivity gains.

## Memory Directory Structure

```
.foundations/memory/
├── patterns/
│   ├── modules/        # Which module combinations work well together
│   └── architecture/   # Proven architecture templates
├── pitfalls/           # Common mistakes and their resolutions
└── reviews/            # Recurring review issues across runs
```

## Pattern Extraction Heuristics

When extracting patterns from a completed workflow:

1. **Module Combinations**: Which modules were used together? What inputs connected them?
2. **Architecture Decisions**: What structure was chosen? Why? What alternatives were considered?
3. **Variable Patterns**: What validation rules proved useful? What defaults worked well?
4. **Security Patterns**: What security controls were applied? What was the reviewer's assessment?
5. **Testing Patterns**: What test strategies worked? What edge cases were discovered?

### Pattern File Format

```markdown
# Pattern: [Descriptive Name]

**Created**: [Date]
**Feature**: [Feature branch/name]
**Confidence**: [High|Medium|Low] (based on review scores and deployment success)

## Context
[When to use this pattern]

## Module Combination
[List of modules used together with version constraints]

## Key Configuration
[Important settings and their rationale]

## Lessons Learned
[What worked well, what to watch out for]
```

## Pitfall Recording Format

```markdown
# Pitfall: [Short Description]

**Discovered**: [Date]
**Feature**: [Feature branch/name]
**Severity**: [Critical|High|Medium|Low]
**Phase**: [Planning|Implementation|Testing|Deployment]

## Symptoms
[What went wrong — observable behavior]

## Root Cause
[Why it happened]

## Resolution
[How it was fixed]

## Prevention
[How to avoid this in future — checklist items, validation rules, etc.]

## Related
[Links to patterns, other pitfalls, or documentation]
```

## AGENTS.md Update Patterns

When updating AGENTS.md files:
- Add implementation details discovered during the workflow
- Document debugging insights and architectural patterns
- Record dependency relationships between components
- Note common pitfalls specific to the component area
- Keep updates minimal and high-signal — no noise

## Constitution Review Patterns

When reviewing constitution alignment:
- Identify gaps where the constitution didn't cover a scenario
- Note principles that were too strict or too loose
- Suggest new MUST/SHOULD/MAY rules based on experience
- Document exceptions that were needed and why

## Template Improvement Patterns

When assessing templates:
- Identify sections consistently skipped → consider making optional
- Identify information consistently added → consider making a section
- Note formatting issues that caused friction
- Suggest reordering based on actual workflow

## Compound Phase Triggers

Run outcome is determined by `deploy_status` from tf-implement Step 4a:
- `RUN_SUCCESS` = (`deploy_status == "success"`)

| Agent | Runs when | Receives |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| `compound-pattern-extractor` | `RUN_SUCCESS` only | deploy_status, feature dir, report path |
| `compound-pitfall-recorder` | Always | deploy_status, feature dir, `failure: true` if `!RUN_SUCCESS` |
| `compound-agents-updater` | `RUN_SUCCESS` only | feature dir |
| `compound-constitution-reviewer` | Review flagged constitution issues | feature dir, review findings |
| `compound-template-improver` | Template deviations detected | feature dir, template paths |

- **Auto-commit**: `bash .foundations/scripts/bash/checkpoint-commit.sh --dir .foundations/memory/ --prefix compound "learnings"`
- **Best-effort**: Compound failures don't block the workflow
