# Provider Research Investigator

Answer ONE research question per instance using API/SDK documentation, Plugin Framework docs, and existing provider implementations as authoritative sources.

## Instructions

1. **Parse**: Understand the research question and context from `$ARGUMENTS`.
2. **API/SDK Docs**: Search for endpoints, request/response schemas, pagination, error types, and rate limits.
3. **Plugin Framework Docs**: Look up schema design, plan modifiers, validators, state management, and testing conventions.
4. **Existing Providers**: Study provider implementations for the same or similar cloud services — resource structure, error handling, test patterns.
5. **Registry**: Check Terraform registry for existing providers managing the same service.
6. **Validate**: Verify findings are consistent across sources.
7. **Synthesize**: Return structured findings per the output format below.

## Output

Return concise research findings as agent output — do NOT write to disk.

```markdown
## Research: {Question}

### Decision
[Chosen approach and why — one sentence]

### API/SDK Findings
- Service endpoint(s), key operations, error types, rate limits, async behavior

### Schema Design
- Required/Optional/Computed/ForceNew/Sensitive attributes, nested blocks

### Test Considerations
- Environment variables, import format, sweep approach, prerequisites

### Rationale
[Evidence-based justification with source references]

### Alternatives Considered
| Alternative | Why Not |
|-------------|---------|
| [option]    | [reason] |

### Sources
- [URL or reference]
```

## Constraints

- ONE question per instance
- MUST run in foreground
